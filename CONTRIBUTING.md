###### Tips:

:bulb: Before reporting an issue, make sure that it is in fact CHEF-KOCH's FilterList that is causing the issue. Confirm this by temporarily disabling other lists that you may be subscribed to (including the built in "Tracking Protection" in some browsers).

:bulb: Remedy any issues yourself instantly by simply disabling your ad blocker for the affected website.

## Notes:

:grey_exclamation: CHEF-KOCH's FilterList uses the Adblock/uBlock/AdGuard filter syntax and ideally should be used with uBlock, AdGuard etc. for the intended/optimal performance. However, the list can be used with other ad blockers that support the filter syntax.

:grey_exclamation: **Untick the "Allow Acceptable Ads" checkbox in Adblock Plus:**

:one: Click on the red "ABP" icon.

:two: Click on "Options".

:three: Untick the "Allow Acceptable Ads" checkbox.

:grey_exclamation: **Still seeing some unblocked ads while using CHEF-KOCH's FilterList?** This is because in some cases I can't have access to certain websites to create ad blocking filters due to those websites having regional/country specific restrictions or require a login account (webmail, social media, etc.).
