## Information about filter usage

**Site-specific or filter-based extensions such as AdBlock Plus, Request Policy, Ghostery, Priv3 and Sharemenot are in general to be avoided**. According to my own security expertise and history I can guarantee that these addons do not add any real privacy layer to the Browser by itself - a proper implementation of the privacy requirements and development efforts on the Browser directly should be preferred on general solutions that prevent tracking by all third parties, rather than a list of specific URLs or hosts.

I do not recommend using any filter lists, instead I highly recommend to work with whitelist only which are based on your own needs. However, a filter lists can help to reduce a possible attack surface based on the daily browsing habits.

## Project Structure

* `/Android` includes the Android related filter list `CK's-Android-FilterList`.
* `/HOSTS` contains HOSTS files for th project. The lists aren't updated frequently. 
* `/I2P & Onion` includes the I2P and .Onion related filter list `CK's-Onion-FilterList`.
* `/Malware` includes the anti-Malware related filter list `CK's-Malware-FilterList`.
* `/Not blocked` includes the excluded filter list `CK's-Wontblock-FilterList`.
* `/Test` includes multiple test filters for IP/ASN and uBlock + uMatrix rulesets.
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the file which shows you how to contribute to the project. It's essentially that you read the guidelines before you submit something.
* `Readme.md` is this file and is the general project overview file.
* `ToDo.md` is like the name already suggest the current todo list. Same as the CONTRIBUTING.md it needs to be read before you submit something.
