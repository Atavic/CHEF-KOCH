## Warning about filter usage

**Site-specific or filter-based extensions such as AdBlock Plus, Request Policy, Ghostery, Priv3 and Sharemenot are in general to be avoided**. According to my own security expertise and history I can guarantee that these addons do not add any real privacy layer to the Browser by itself - a proper implementation of the privacy requirements and development efforts on the Browser directly should be preferred on general solutions that prevent tracking by all third parties, rather than a list of specific URLs or hosts.

I do not recommend using any filter lists, instead I highly suggest to work with whitelist only, based on your own needs. However, a filter lists can help to reduce a possible attack surface based on the daily browsing habits.


## Installation

Make sure you have an ad-blocker installed in your desktop or mobile browsers that uses [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) filter syntax:

#### uBlock Origin / Nano Adblocker
  - Open uBlock Origin (uBo) options panel
  - Navigate to Filter lists page/tab
  - On the bottom of the page, there should be an 'Custom' section (you might need to click the + to reveal the 'Import' button, click on it:
  - Copy & paste into the textbox:
  
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/master/CK's-FilterList.txt
  ```
  
  - Now there should appear a yellow button called "Parse", click it
  - Lastly you need to go to the top and hit the yellow "Update now" button
  - This method works quite similar in order Browser Extensions too, like AdBlock Plus or AdGuard.
