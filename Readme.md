#### uBlock Origins
  - Go to ublock Origins settings
  - Navigate to 3rd-party filters page
  - On the bottom of the page, there should be an textbox where there are a bunch of example urls
  - Copy and paste into the textbox:
  
  ```
  https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/master/CK's-FilterList.txt
  ```
  
  - Now there should appear a yellow button called "Parse", click it
  - Lastly you need to go to the top and hit the yellow "Update now" button
  - This method works similar in order Browser Extensions too, like AdBlock Plus or AdGuard.
  
## Manually updating
It seems uBlock can sometimes slow with updating the filter list by itself, so if you want to stay up to the latest version as fast as possible you need to manually update it:
  - Go to uBlock Origins settings
  - Navigate to 3rd-party filters page
  - There should be an custom filter named: CHEF-KOCH's Filter List
  - Click on the "purge cache" on the right of the name
  - Now there should appear an yellow button at the upper left named: "Apply Changes", click it
  - It should now show the correct amount of filter items
