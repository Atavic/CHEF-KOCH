### CK's Filter List todo

- [ ] Check redundant entries automatically (is that it even possible?) (high-prio)
- [ ] Remove most entries and replace it with more intelligent syntax rules which works for all websites (high-prio)
- [ ] Reduce the file-size (low-prio)
- [ ] Sort it alphabetically (low-prio)
- [ ] Make categories for Porn, Malware, etc. to easier work with the list (helps possible contributors) (high-prio)
- [ ] The checksum is incorrect because I make my changes (generate the checksum and then I need to paste it into the list which obviously changes the checksum again ... This needs to be changed (is that even possible?) (low-prio)
- [x] Readme.md improvements
- [ ] Fix all reported issue (high-prio)
